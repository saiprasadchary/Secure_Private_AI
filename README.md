Model Testing Instructions
==========================

Welcome to the model testing instructions! In this file, you'll find three separate models: a CNN model, a federated learning model, and a distributed swarm model. Each model has been trained and saved as `.h5` files for your convenience.

Models Available
----------------

1.  CNN Model
2.  Federated Learning Model
3.  Distributed Swarm Model

Testing Setup
-------------

To test these models, follow these steps:

1.  **Open Colab**: Open Google Colab in your web browser.
    
2.  **Upload Model Files**: Upload all three individual `.h5` files corresponding to the models you want to test.
    
3.  **Open Testing Files**: Open the testing files provided in this folder in different tabs or windows. There are three testing files available, one for each model.
    
4.  **Execute Testing Files**: Execute each testing file according to the test data you want to use.

Testing Files
-------------

1.  `test_1.ipynb`: Use this file to test the CNN model.
2.  `test_2.ipynb`: Use this file to test the federated learning model.
3.  `test_3.ipynb`: Use this file to test the distributed swarm model.

Follow the instructions within each testing file to load the respective model and test data, and then execute the testing code.

Happy testing! If you encounter any issues or have any questions, feel free to reach out.
